          <br />
          <p>
            Your use of the Site is subject at all times to these Terms of
            Service and our Privacy Policy. Any content, including but not

            is in addition to, and does in no way replace or supplant, the End
            User License Agreement (the "EULA") that accompanied the Lemuria
            software and to which the Lemuria software is subject. You also may
            be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when
            you use or purchase certain other Lemuria services, affiliate
            services, third-party content or software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lemruria recommends that all users periodically review these Terms
            since Lemuria is a live and evolving community. Lemuria reserves the
            right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to revise, amend,
            change, add to, delete, or update these terms and the Service,
            effective with or without prior notice by publishing the revised or
            updated Agreement on our website at Lemuria. The revised or updated
            Agreement is effective upon publication and your continued use of
            the Site and the Service following notice and publication of the
            revised or updated Agreement on the site will constitute your
            acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree with these
            revised or updated Terms, you are obligated to terminate your User
            ID immediately and cancel any services for which you have signed up.

          <strong>Eligibility and Age Requirements:</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Site and the Service are for users age 13 and over. In
            accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of
            2000, if you are under the age of 13, personal information cannot be
            collected from you and thus, you are prohibited from creating a
            membership account through the Service, shall not be eligible to
            enter any prize awarding events and/or promotions, and are asked not
            to provide any personal information of any kind on the Site, through
            the Service, or to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            As noted, the Site and the Service are for users age 13 and over.
            While children of all ages may view the Site, only those 13 or older
            can use the Site and related games and services. We will not
            knowingly accept any applications or other submissions from anyone
            under the age of 13. If we learn that anyone under the age of 13 is
            attempting to make an application or place an order, we will
            terminate the transaction if it is feasible to do so and
            subsequently delete any personal information sent to us. Also, we do
            not knowingly accept, collect, maintain or use personal information
            regarding children under the age of 13 on this Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a parent or legal guardian of a child discovers that their child
            under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable
            information and would like Lemuria to stop collecting such
            information, or have the child's personal information deleted from
            our database records, they should contact us at
            contact@lemuria-nft.com. We will review, update, or remove the
            child's information as requested within reasonable time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are over the age of 13, but still considered a minor under
            the law of the relevant state, we ask that you review these Terms as
            well as our Privacy Policy with your parent(s) or legal guardian(s)
            to ensure they understand and agree to them. We strongly encourage
            parents or legal guardians to be positive and active role models to
            their children and spend time together online with their children,
            familiarizing themselves with the Service and overseeing any
            communication between their children and any other Internet users.
            It is highly suggested that parents or legal guardians educate their
            children about online conduct, specifically including but not
            limited to, never revealing, distributing, or otherwise
            communicating their personal identifying information such as real
            names, images, addresses, or phone numbers without parental or
            guardian permission when using the Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lemuria is an ever-evolving community comprised of many different
            participants with different experiences and backgrounds. While we
            may choose to monitor and take action upon inappropriate player
            conduct, chat or links to the Service, it is possible that at any
            time there may be language or other material accessible on or
            through the Service that may be inappropriate for children or
            offensive to some users of any age. This agreement outlines rules of
            conduct for players accessing the Service. We cannot ensure that all
            players will adhere to these terms and not provide content or access
            to content that parents or guardians may find inappropriate or that
            any user may find objectionable. Lemuria does not pre-screen the
            content, the materials or the communications transmitted by each
            player. As such, it is highly encouraged that parents provide
            guidance to users under the age of majority and exercise their
            parental responsibility in restricting access of their children to
            such content.

        <li>
          <strong>User Identity/Account Creation:</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            When creating a user identity ("User ID", "account") by completing
            and submitting the Lemuria registration form, you represent that you
            have reviewed, understand, and are in full compliance with the
            Terms. You must also provide truthful and accurate information in
            the registration process and be who you claim to be. If you are a
            minor, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must preside over your
            registration process and/or complete the registration process for
            you, in which case they will take full responsibility for all
            obligations under this Agreement and are completely liable for all
            activities conducted through the Account by you or any other party,
            whether authorized by the registered user or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the registration process, you must select login information
            ("Login Information") comprised of a unique login name ("User ID,"
            "account name") and a secure password ("password").
          </p>
          <p>
            As creator of your User ID, you are completely responsible for your
            identity and Lemuria will not tolerate offensive, obscene, or
            otherwise inappropriate user identities. If a User ID violates any
            part of these Terms, determined at the sole and absolute discretion
            of Lemuria Support Staff, we may immediately, temporarily, or
            permanently ban such User ID from the Site or Service, with or
            without notice or prior warning.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Security:</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            You, as the registered user of an account, are ultimately and
            completely responsible for maintaining confidentiality of your login
            information and computer system used to access the Site or Service.
            Further, you are solely responsible and liable for any and all uses
            of your Login Information, whether authorized by you or not. You may
            not directly or indirectly reveal your password to anyone for any
            reason at any time or allow anyone else to access the account.
            Sharing, trading, swapping, selling, buying, bartering, or otherwise
            distributing accounts or account/Login Information is strictly
            prohibited and subject to disciplinary action up to and possibly
            including service termination at the sole and absolute discretion of
            our support staff. Lemuria will NEVER ask for your account password
            and you should NEVER reveal it, EVER; even when contacting us about
            an account issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            When creating a User ID, you agree to indemnify and hold Lemuria and
            its affiliates harmless for any improper use of such identity
            including, but not limited to, improper or illegal use by someone to
            whom you have revealed your password in any way. Lemuria is not
            responsible for any misuse of your User ID, whether such misuse is
            by you or by third parties. When interacting in any online community
            we strongly recommend that all players think before they click and
            engage in safe internet practices at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you discover that the confidentiality of your account Login
            Information may have been compromise, you are required to
            immediately and truthfully report this to Lemuria as soon as
            possible by emailing or submitting a request for help through the
            Lemuria Helpdesk. We will coordinate with proper investigating
            authorities to hold individuals perpetrating online crimes
            accountable for their actions, including those who submit fraudulent
            or false reports.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disciplinary Action and User ID Termination:</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            Lemuria can and does issue warnings and temporary suspensions and
            permanent terminations of user identities for user violations. We
            retain the sole discretion as to when and how to impose warnings,
            penalties and/or disciplinary actions. The severity of a violation
            and number of occurrences factor into the decisions, but they are
            not the only measures used. User identities may be banned, both
            temporarily and permanently, without prior warning.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid any doubt, you acknowledge that Lemuria has sole discretion
            with respect to penalties and disciplinary actions even if there is
            a credit remaining on your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you feel you or your User ID has been unfairly warned or
            disciplined, please submit a request for help at the Lemuria
            Helpdesk or send an email with pertinent detail to
            contact@lemuria-nft.com. All submitted account action disputes will
            be carefully reviewed yet Lemuria will only take action with valid
            claims in its determination.

          <strong>Payment Gateways:</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            Lemuria strives to provide free quality games via the Site and
            Service. Users are not required to purchase in-game items to fully
            enjoy the Service, however, Users may charge Virtual Money to their
            accounts using PaymentWall to acquire those charged Items. Before
            using either payment gateway, Lemuria recommends you to review their
            Terms of Service carefully and be sure you agree to their terms
            separate from this ToS. When you present payment gateway information
            to Lemuria, you represent to Lemuria that you are the authorized
            user of such payment gateway account being used to acquire Virtual
            Money. Lemuria is not affiliated with PaymentWall. If any payment is
            reversed, cancelled or charged back, your Account with us may be
            immediately suspended without notice or further be terminated if
            found fraud.

        <li>
          <strong>Server Outages:</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            There will be regular periods of server maintenance as well as spot
            maintenance, usually coinciding with a new game or new service.
            Lemuria will do its best to limit server down time to twenty four
            hours. However, Lemuria is not liable for any loss of usage or data
            experienced as a result of maintenance or other down times and you
            agree to hold Lemuria harmless for any such loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lemuria will not be responsible for a user's inability to access
            paid services during server maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lemuria shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform
            resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Lemuria,
            including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to
            unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Lemuria's control such as
            acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or
            military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages
            of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, we cannot and do not promise or ensure that you will be
            able to access your Account whenever you want, and there may be
            extended periods of time when you cannot access your Account. You
            assume the entire risk as to the results and performance of the
            Software and the Game in connection with your hardware and software,
            and you assume the entire cost of all servicing, repair and/or
            correction of your hardware and software.
